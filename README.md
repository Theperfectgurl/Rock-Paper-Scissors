# Rock-Paper-Scissors

## Introduction
This project is a simple implementation of the classic game Rock Paper Scissors. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to use basic web development skills, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to create an interactive web application. 

## Project Description
The Rock Paper Scissors game allows user to play against the computer. The user selects their move (rock, paper, or scissors), and the computer randomly selects its move. The game then determines the winner based on the rules of Rock Paper Scissors:
- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

The project is part of the Odin Project curriculum, specifically designed to reinforce my understanding of DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.

## Skills Demonstrated
By completing this project, I will have demonstrated the following skills:
- **HTML**: Structuring the game interface with semantic HTML elements.
- **CSS**: Styling the game interface to make it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Implementing the game logic, handling user interactions, and manipulating the DOM to update the game state.

## Self-Reflection
At the end of this project, I will review and document what I have learned and any challenges I faced during the development process. This reflection will help solidify my understanding and provide insights for future projects.

## How to Play
1. Open the Rock Paper Scissors game in your browser.
2. Select your move by clicking on one of the buttons (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
3. The computer will randomly select its move.
4. The result of the game will be displayed, indicating whether you won, or lost.
5. Play again to improve your score!
